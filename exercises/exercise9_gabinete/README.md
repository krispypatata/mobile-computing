## Program Description  
<div align="justify">
This program is an improved version of an existing Todo application discussed in the lab, incorporating user authentication and additional user information storage in Firestore. It extends the signup page to include fields for first name and last name, ensuring comprehensive user data collection. The application validates user inputs on both the login and signup screens, enforcing proper email format, a minimum password length of 6 characters, and the requirement of first and last names. Through Firebase integration, user data is securely stored in Firestore, guaranteeing reliable data persistence. The user interface is designed for optimal usability, providing clear feedback on input validation errors.
