## Program Description  
<div align="justify">
This program manages Slambook data, initially presenting an empty friend list. Users can add friends to the list using the Slambook interface. When all details are correct and valid, users can click the button at the lower right of the Slambook interface to add the friend to the list. Additionally, users can click on friend names to view their details. The program also features a drawer for quick access to both the Slambook and the friend list. Enhancing its functionality, the program incorporates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, facilitating dynamic interaction with the Slambook data. This interactivity is supported by Firebase, ensuring real-time data persistence and a seamless user experience across devices. Moreover, the program utilizes the Provider package for efficient state management.
