## Program Description  
<div align="justify">
This program is a simple contacts book application built using Flutter. The application utilizes the flutter_contacts package to access and manage device contacts. Users can view a list of their existing contacts on the homepage screen and tap on a contact to view its details. On this contact details page, users can tap on a "Delete" button to remove the currently viewed contact. Furthermore, users also have the ability to add a new contact by tapping on an "Add" button at the bottom right corner of the homepage screen. The "Add" button navigates the user to a form page where they can enter the details of the new contact, such as first name, last name, phone number, and email address. After filling out the form, users can tap on the "Save" button to add the new contact. The contacts list on the homepage screen is refreshed after adding a new contact or deleting an existing one.
