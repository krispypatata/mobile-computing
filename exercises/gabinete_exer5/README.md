## Program Description  
This program manages Slambook data, initially presenting an empty friend list. Users can add friends to the list using the Slambook interface. When all details are correct and valid, users can click the button at the lower right of the Slambook interface to add the friend to the list. Additionally, users can click on friend names to view their details. The program also features a drawer for quick access to both the Slambook and the friend list.
